# Caesar Cipher in Python

A beginner-friendly Python project that implements the *Caesar Cipher*, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
This tool allows you to *encrypt* and *decrypt* messages by shifting letters by a user-defined value.

##  Features
- Encrypt plain text messages with a custom shift value
- Decrypt encrypted messages back to the original text
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers)

---

## How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- C → F

Decryption simply reverses the process by shifting letters back.
